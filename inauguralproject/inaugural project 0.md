This assigment has the purpose of solving the maximazition problem for given patameters. 

We firstly import the relevant packages, that are relevant for the execution of the following assignment. 


```python
import numpy as np 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd 
```

1)


```python
#We define the basis of the function, which will solve the first equation. 

def func1(v, epsilon, m, w, tau0, tau1, kappa)
    optimal_utility=-10

#We now create a range for the variable l, for which we loop over. The given interval is [0,1]
    l_rng=np.linspace(0,1)  

#Define x and loop for c which ranges from [0,x]
    x= m 0 w*l - [tau0*w*l+tau1* max(w*l-kappa,0)]
    c_rng=np.linspace(0,x)
return c_optimal, l_optimal
```
