# Model analysis project

Our project is titled The cournot model and is about modelling the instance where two firms compete with setting the optimal quantity, which maximizes profits for both firms. This kind of competition is called Cournot Competition. In the extension of the project, we look at how the equilibrium quantities are affected, when a third firms enter the market. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject-1.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, its rquired importing the following packages from numpy, scipy, sympy and ipywidgets.
