# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **GDP in the European Union** and is about the development of GDP over the oeriode 2010-2019.
We examine which of the selected countries have the highest and lowest growth rates, by examining the Annual growth in GDP. 
We compare to respective countries, and see whether the population growth can explain the difference in GDP. 


The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires you to install matplitlib-venn.
